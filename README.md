## Development Structure

The frontend development of ProjecTrack is based on **React** and employs **React Router** to enable a **Single Page Application (SPA)** design. The backend is powered by **Firebase**, which is used to create the website, database, and member system. The development tools used include **Webpack** for module bundling, **Babel** for ensuring compatibility of JavaScript across different environments, **NPM** for package management, **ESLint** for syntax checking and enforcing coding standards, and Github for version control using **Git**.
